In this code snippet, you need to replace 'your_sns_topic_arn' with the ARN of your SNS topic, and 'recipient@example.com' with the recipient's email address.

The code retrieves the Glue job names, processes the job status information, generates an output table, and composes an email message with the table content. It then publishes the message to the specified SNS topic, including the recipient email address as a message attribute.

With this approach, the SNS topic will send a single email to the specified recipient with the Glue job statuses included in the email body. The email will be sent based on the configured subscription settings of the SNS topic, such as email endpoints or other supported protocols.
